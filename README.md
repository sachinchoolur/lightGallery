    ```

#### Include CSS and Javascript files

First of all, include lightgallery.css in the &lt;head> of the document. If
you want include any lightGallery plugin such as thumbnails or zoom, you need to
include respective css files as well.

Alternatively you can include `lightgallery-bundle.css` which contains
lightGallery and all plugin styles instead of separate stylesheets.

If you like you can also import scss files instead of css files from the `scss`
folder.

```HTML
<head>
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/lightgallery.css" />

    <!-- lightgallery plugins -->
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/lg-zoom.css" />
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/lg-thumbnail.css" />


    <!-- OR -->

    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/lightgallery-bundle.css" />
</head>
```

Then include lightgallery.umd.js into your document. If you want to include any
lightgallery plugin you can include it after lightgallery.umd.js.

```HTML
<body>
    ....

    <script src="js/lightgallery.umd.js"></script>

    <!-- lightgallery plugins -->
    <script src="js/plugins/lg-thumbnail.umd.js"></script>
    <script src="js/plugins/lg-zoom.umd.js"></script>
</body>
```

lightGallery supports AMD, CommonJS and ES6 modules too.

```JavaScript
import lightGallery from 'lightgallery';

// Plugins
import lgThumbnail from 'lightgallery/plugins/thumbnail'
import lgZoom from 'lightgallery/plugins/zoom'

```

#### The markup

lightgallery does not force you to use any kind of markup. you can use whatever
markup you want.
<a href="https://www.lightgalleryjs.com/demos/html-markup/">Here</a> can find
detailed examples of different kinds of markups.

If you know the original size of the media, you can pass it via
`data-lg-size="${width}-${height}"` attribute for the initial
[zoom](https://www.lightgalleryjs.com/docs/settings/#zoomFromOrigin) animation.
But, this is completely optional.

```HTML
<div id="lightgallery">
    <a href="img/img1.jpg" data-lg-size="1600-2400">
        <img alt=".." src="img/thumb1.jpg" />
    </a>
    <a href="img/img2.jpg" data-lg-size="1024-800">
        <img alt=".." src="img/thumb2.jpg" />
    </a>
    ...
</div>
```

#### Initialize lightGallery
